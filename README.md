# 4-bit-Arithmetic-Unit-with-Addition-Subtraction-Multiplication-and-Division
ðŸŒŸ Excited to Share My Latest Project: A 4-Bit Arithmetic Unit! ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™m thrilled to introduce my recent project: a 4-Bit Arithmetic Unit, designed using the top-down design methodology in Verilog. This modular and reusable approach allowed me to implement core arithmetic operations efficiently.

Key Features of the ALU
Addition

Built with a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder:
1 Half Adder for the initial stage.
3 Full Adders for carry propagation.
Subtraction

Utilizes B's 2â€™s Complement logic with the same Ripple Carry Adder structure.
Multiplication

Implemented via Boothâ€™s Algorithm, including:
4-bit Ripple Carry Adder.
Arithmetic Right Shifter for iterative shifting.
Division

Designed using Behavioral Modeling for clarity and simplicity.
Why This Project Stands Out
Using a top-down design approach, I broke the system into smaller, reusable modules, ensuring clarity, scalability, and ease of debugging.

Project Details
Language: Verilog
Tools: Xilinx Vivado
Takeaway: Modular design is key to tackling complex systems!
